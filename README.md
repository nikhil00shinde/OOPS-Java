# OOPS-Java
#### Four Key Principle

1. **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and method into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access.
- Data is hidden using the `private` keyword.
- Provide getter and setter methods to access and modify private data.

- [Code]();

- [ ] - Encapsulation ensures data security by preventing direct modificatrion.

2. Inheritance (Code Reusability)
Inheritance allows a class (child) to **inherit** properties and behaviors from the another class (parent).
- Use the `extends` keyword.
- Promotes code reusabilty.
- Parent class methods can be overridden in the child class.

- [Code]()

- [ ] - Inheritance promotes reuse of existing functionality.


3. Polymorphism (Many Forms)
Polymorphism allows a single method name to have different behaviors.

- **Two Types:**
   - **Method Overloading** (Compile-time polymorphism)
   - **Method Overriding** (Runtime polymorphism)
